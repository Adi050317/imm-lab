# Welcome to the Interactive Mind & Movement Lab (IMM LAB!)



We are a cognitive neuroscience laboratory in the Department of Psychology at the University of British Columbia.

<br>
Our broad aim is to understand how we see and interact with the world around us. The visual world we live in is not only complex but constantly changing. At every moment, our brain needs to perform demanding tasks (which any existing fancy machine cannot do better yet!), receiving, organizing, and giving meaning to the excessive flow of visual input to guide our actions and decisions. We seek to understand how the brain manages this feat to keep our movement interactive, flexible, safe, and goal-relevant in dynamic and even distracting visual environments.

<br>
We use functional neuroimaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure the human brain. We also use behavioural methods to measure human perceptual, cognitive, and motor capacities. Combining different techniques (mostly fMRI+MEG, but sometimes fNIRS+EEG to allow participants to make more active and less-constrained movements), we focus on the dynamic time courses of neural activities occurring in different parts of the brain.
